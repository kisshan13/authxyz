# Advanced usage

Using the providers with maximum customization is what we believe. For this thing we have came up with three things :

- Custom Schema
- Request Processors
- Triggers

## Custom Schema

You can extend the base schema of your adapter by using your own schema.

## Request Processors

Request processors are something that you really want to user in-order to return custom responses and the the pre-processing of the request.

## Triggers

Triggers are the way to send mail updates to the users from the server , using the auth provider.
